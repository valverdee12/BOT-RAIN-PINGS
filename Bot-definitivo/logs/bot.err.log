  Puppeteer old Headless deprecation warning:[0m[33m
    In the near future `headless: true` will default to the new Headless mode
    for Chrome instead of the old Headless implementation. For more
    information, please see https://developer.chrome.com/articles/new-headless/.
    Consider opting in early by passing `headless: "new"` to `puppeteer.launch()`
    If you encounter any bugs, please report them to https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/new/choose.[0m

(node:23540) DeprecationWarning: The ready event has been renamed to clientReady to distinguish it from the gateway READY event and will only emit under that name in v15. Please use clientReady instead.
(Use `node --trace-deprecation ...` to show where the warning was created)
